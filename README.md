Then, models were created with demand forecasting methods, which is the purpose of the problem. Last Period's Demand, Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, Holt's Exponential Smoothing, Seasonal Forecasting and ARIMA are demand forecasting methods used. These models were evaluated and compared according to error metrics. The best model suitable for the data is presented and interpreted.
